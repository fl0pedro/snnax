SNNAX
=====


SNNAX is a lightweight library for implementing Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is JAX. It leverages the excellent and intuitive [Equinox Library](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/).
The core of SNNAX is a module that stacks layers of pre-defined or custom defined SNNs and Equinox neural network modules, and providing the functions to call them in a single *scan* loop. This mode of operation enables feedback loops across the layers of SNNs, while leveraging GPU acceleration as much as possible
